#Lession #1 - Validate working python container

'''
In this lesson we will be working from a docker container for developement.
Python code will be executed from a docker container rather than from the local machine.

This container allows for the developer to have greater:
  - flexibility with application development
  - more cross platform services
  - develop a greater sense of microservices.
