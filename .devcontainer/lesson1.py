#Lession #1 - Validate working python container/environment

'''
In this lesson we will be working from either a development docker container or on your local PC.
A development docker container can help you execute youe Python rather than from the local machine.
Running the Docker engine may require more compute resource than what is available

The alternative option is to install the Python Engine on your local machine
